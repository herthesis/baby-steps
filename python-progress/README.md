# Python Progress

## Introduction

This repository documents a structured, self-directed journey learning Python. It began with the 100 Days of Code challenge to build consistent coding habits and establish a strong foundation. The work here demonstrates applied skills, reflective practice, and ongoing growth beyond the initial 100 days. 

### Current Status 

Day 6 of 100 (Week 1), actively updating weekly logs and projects. 

### Repository Structure

**Progress Tracker** - Regularly updated logs of exercises, experiments, and reflections with links to Colab learning notebooks.
  - Section 1: 100 Days of Code
  - Section 2: Beyond 100 days (continuing study and more advanced projects)

**Weekly Folders** - Organized by week (Week 1 - Week 15), containing notes, exercises, and Colab links.

**Projects Folder** - Mini-projects created during the challenge and beyond, demonstrating applied problem-solving and Python proficiency.

## How to Use This Repository

- Review the Progress Tracker for a chronological view of learning activities.
- Browse Weekly Folders to see detailed exercises, code snippets, and Colab notebooks.
- Explore the Projects Folder to see applied projects and problem-solving outputs. 

### Purpose 

This repository serves as a professional record of continuous learning in Python. It demonstrates consistency, applied skill, and reflective growth, supporting both academic and technical development.

### Impact Statement

The combination of the structured challenge, reflective logging, and project-based outputs illustrates disciplined learning, technical competence, and the ability to independently acquire and apply skills demonstrating qualities valued in research and technical roles.
