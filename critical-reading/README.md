## Critical Reading   

This directory contains structured notes and reflections on scientific articles I read while preparing for a future PhD in bioniformatics and cancer research. 

Each article gets its own subfolder or file with responses to a standard set of questions meant to strengthen my skills in:

- Summarizing research clearly
- Evaluating methods and data quickly
- Identifying limitations and biases
- Connecting research to broader implications in genomics, epidemiology, and cancer studies
- Generating new ideas for reproductability and extension
