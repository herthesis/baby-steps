## Article Template

This template contains the structured set of questions I will answer for each scientific article I read. 

The goal is to develop critical reading skills and build expertise in bioinformatics, genomics, epidemiology, and cancer research. 


---

### Framing & Context
- What problem is being addressed, and why is it important?
- How does this fit into the larger field (bioinformatics, genomics, epidemiology, etc.)?
- What knowledge gap does this work aim to fill?

### Methods & Rigor
- What data were used (source, sample size, potential biases)?
- Which tools, algorithms, or statistical methods were applied, and are they appropriate?
- What assumptions underlie the methodology?
- Could the methods be reproduced based on the information provided?

### Results & Interpretation
- What are the main findings (in plain language and technical terms)?
- Do the results support the authorsâ€™ conclusions?
- Are there alternative explanations?

### Limitations & Biases
- What weaknesses or blind spots exist (study design, data sources, methods)?
- What biases might influence the results (sampling, computational, publication)?

### Implications & Extensions
- Why do these findings matter (for cancer research, public health, or bioinformatics)?
- How could this research be extended with new data, improved tools, or different perspectives?
- What would be the next logical question if this were your project?

### Personal Research Development
- What techniques, datasets, or coding skills should I learn to conduct similar work?
- What challenges would I face if reproducing this study?
- What sparks my curiosity that could lead to an independent project?
